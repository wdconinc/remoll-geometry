# Geometry for the 12 GeV MOLLER experiment

This repository contains the geometry for the 12 GeV MOLLER experiment at Jefferson Lab.

Since various aspects of the experiment are using the geometry (as submodules in their
repositories), the geometry is separated out as an individual repository.

## Directories

### Schema

The `schema` directory contains the xml schema for GDML files. There should only be minor
differences between different branches and revisions.

### Scripts

The `scripts` directory contians automatic geometry generation scripts.
